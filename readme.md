The files in this repo download San Diego mass transit data and read in a few 
of its files. The original dataset can be found on the [San Diego mass transit 
website](https://www.sdmts.com/business-center/developers). The files are in 
General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) format, [which is described here](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/).
